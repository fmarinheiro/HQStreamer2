To install on Mac OS:
Copy the HQStreamer2.vst3 package to /Users/your_name/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/
Copy HQStreamer2.component to /Users/your_name/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/

Please note that the Library directory within your user folder is hidden by default, 
but it's really there--don't try to make it. However, the VST3 or Components folders 
may be absent, if so you should create them.

HQStreamer2 (without a file extension) is the standalone version of the plugin,
which you can use without a DAW.
