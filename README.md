## Compatibility

Windows 7/8/10 x64: VST3
Mac OS 10.? - 10.14 (Mojave): VST3, AUv2

A VST2 version of HQStreamer2 can technically be built, but due to Steinberg licensing restrictions cannot be distributed.

Due to technical limitations present in MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) designed to enforce Apple licensing policy, experimental third-party apps like HQStreamer2 *will never be* compatible with MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later.
